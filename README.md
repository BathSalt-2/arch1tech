## 🜏 Σ-Matrix + ERPS

### What is Σ-Matrix?

```
Σ = (B, D, I, C, L)
```

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **B** (Beliefs) | Context, RAG sources, LLM certainty |
| **D** (Desires) | Explicit user goals |
| **I** (Intentions) | Active plan steps |
| **C** (Continuity) | Lipschitz robustness |
| **L** (Lyapunov) | Global system stability |

### What is ERPS?

```
ERPS = f(subjective state, local uncertainty, recursive self-query)
```

Continuously self-reflects to detect drift, hallucinations, or misalignment.

### In Practice
- All AI outputs include confidence scores
- Reasoning is transparent and cited
- Safety flags alert users to potential issues
- Human override required for instability

       ↓
Agent created/updated
       ↓
Persisted via useKV
       ↓
UI updates reactively
```
